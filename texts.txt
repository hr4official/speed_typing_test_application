The purpose of our lives is to be happy
Life is what happens when you’re busy making other plans
Get busy living or get busy dying
You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough
Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up
If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people or things
Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game
Money and success don't change people; they merely amplify what is already there
Not how long, but how well you have lived is the main thing
The unexamined life is not worth living
